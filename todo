# List of features for baelish (in order):

- Make sure default and all scan work (going to need to figure out sudo run)
- Figure out how to run processes and the background but still show they're progress (maybe default cmd just prints status of current processes with some project/host info?)
- Setup a progress bar / percentage display for processes (sysout/flush?)
- Switch command for handling multiple hosts
- Automatic saving of host objects (XML?)
- Ability to load projects (load hosts from xml with notes and tagging)
- Means for user to view ports/services and os found on the current host
- Means for the user to leave notes associated with ports and os
- Means for the user to tag files (loot, exploit code, downloaded files) to ports/os
- Some sort of bash override (! to signify?)
- Make sure the introduction of the bash override feature doesn't create security issues
- Create a way for uses to export all info (ports, services, notes, tagged files) into some sort of summary file (export as a .md file and use pandoc to convert it to a pdf?)

----------------------------------
Current end goal for initial phase

Additional ideas/features:
- Build in some more scans: nmap scripting, other tools like dirb and nikto
- UDP scanning could be an easy add in
- I'm thinking that we need to rename to note-map. Simple and conveys meaning
